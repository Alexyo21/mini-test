UPDATED VERSION OF MINI

custom version of mini made by using some extra patch, thanks to MasterofGalaxies and eigenform.

has extra debug commands and also sd debug but it takes  a while. 
remember to set the resolution based on your tv, cause i use progressive, but it cannot work if you don't have an hdmi.
i suggest using it with gumboot for having maybe more booting capabilities, let's say in simple words...;) for more modify the menu.lst file.
soon i'll update the readme...
